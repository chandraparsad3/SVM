# SVM Examples Repository

Welcome to the SVM Examples Repository! This project provides clear examples of Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementations using scikit-learn in Python. Each section demonstrates different aspects of SVM, including various kernels, support vector regression, and support vector classification.

## Project Overview

SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm widely used for classification and regression tasks. This repository serves as an educational resource for understanding SVM concepts and their practical implementations. The examples are designed to be simple, yet informative, making it easy for both beginners and experienced users to grasp SVM's functionality.

## Table of ContentsCertainly! Here's the revised version without the license information and the installation dependencies part:

1. [SVM Kernels](SVM_Kernels.ipynb): Introduction to SVM with different kernels - Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid. Synthetic data is generated for visualization, and basic SVM usage is demonstrated.

2. [Support Vector Regression (SVR)](SVR.ipynb): Focuses on Support Vector Regression using a linear kernel. The example includes data generation, model training, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

3. [Support Vector Classification (SVC)](SVM.ipynb): Demonstrates Support Vector Classification with a linear kernel using synthetic classification data. Classification performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandraparsad3/SVM.git
   ```

2. **Explore Examples:**
   - Dive into each file to understand SVM implementation with different kernels.
   - Run the provided examples for hands-on experience.

## Usage

1. Follow the instructions in each Jupyter notebook to execute the SVM examples.
2. Customize the examples or integrate SVM into your projects as needed.
